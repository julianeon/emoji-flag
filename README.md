## About

This is a simple React app, created using create-react-app, which shows emoji repeating up and sideways arcoss the page.

It's basically just three things:
1. a grid from semantic-ui-react, in columns
2. lodash, to repeat the columns vertically and horizontally
3. JPEG of an emoji

It's also like one page of code, with 5 components, only 2 of which are longer than 1 line, in App.js. I didn't touch the CSS.

It's not complicated.

You can see the code on Git here:

### How to Run

Remix it from Glitch or clone it from GitHub then cd into dir and 'yarn start'.

### How to Improve

3-D Render the emoji so that they... just kidding.

I think it would be neat to use state to make the emoji blink. Might do that eventually.
